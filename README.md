CodeReview2

Hello and welcome to my second CodeReview, 

I must say it was pretty challenging, especially knowing about Bootsrap now 
but not being able to use it. 

However, I did manage to bring it almost as close as in the pictures with a couple of things 
that make it different. 

First, I added a nice drop-down effect that I discovered online and I was really enthusiastic to use 
as it also helped notice when the page was refreshed. I hope you also like it. 

Secondly, I managed to make the pictures after the 'How to become a developer' banner, equal between them
and make them look more in order along the banner. 

I noticed that the elon musk picture that was provided, was a tiny bit smaller than the rest,
therefore I made a class and gave the same dimentions for all images.

Furthermore, I was editing and building the site on my big monitor,
so when I opened the files at some point on my laptop, I saw that the h2 elements with the titles
were not the same. I fixed this issue by putting a different @media size that would cover both screens. 

The mobile version works and looks great, however, I was always using the extention in chrome 'Window Resizer',
and therefore I went with the mobile resolutions this extention has available. I did find out, that Firefox browser
has even smaller version available, and it works great there too with 480.

It has been tested on:  320x568, 
                        375x667,
                        1024x768,
                        1440x900,
                        1920x1080.

I also tried the tablet mode with @media query, however I could not manage to make 2 columns appear, but other than that,
everything works and looks nice.
