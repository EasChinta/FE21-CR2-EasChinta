      <h2>TESLA</h2><br>
      <h1>Elon Musk</h1><br><br>
      <p>
      <pre>
        Elon Musk co-founded and leads Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and The Boring
        Company. As the co-founder and CEO of Tesla, Elon leads all product
        design, engineering and global manufacturing of the company's electric
        vehicles, battery products and solar energy products. Since the
        company’s inception in 2003, Tesla’s mission has been to accelerate the
        world’s transition to sustainable energy. The first Tesla product, the
        Roadster sports car, debuted in 2008, followed by the Model S sedan,
        which was introduced in 2012, and the Model X SUV, which launched in
        2015. Model S received Consumer Reports’ Best Overall Car and has been
        named the Ultimate Car of the Year by Motor Trend, while Model X was the
        first SUV ever to earn 5-star safety ratings in every category and
        sub-category in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s
        tests. In 2017, Tesla began deliveries of Model 3, a mass-market
        electric vehicle with more than 320 miles of range, and unveiled Tesla
        Semi, which is designed to save owners at least $200,000 over a million
        miles based on fuel costs alone. In 2019, Tesla unveiled Cybertruck,
        which will have better utility than a traditional truck and more
        performance than a sports car, as well as the Model Y compact SUV, which
        began customer deliveries in early 2020. Tesla also produces three
        energy storage products, the Powerwall home battery, the Powerpack
        commercial-scale battery, and Megapack, which is designed for
        utility-scale installations. In 2016, Tesla became the world’s first
        vertically-integrated sustainable energy company with the acquisition of
        SolarCity, the leading provider of solar power systems in the United
        States, and in 2017 released Solar Roof – a beautiful and affordable
        energy generation product. As lead designer at SpaceX, Elon oversees the
        development of rockets and spacecraft for missions to Earth orbit and
        ultimately to other planets. In 2008, the SpaceX Falcon 1 was the first
        privately developed liquid fuel rocket to reach orbit, and SpaceX made
        further history in 2017 by re-flying both a Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon
        spacecraft for the first time. Soon after, Falcon Heavy, the most
        powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two, completed
        its first flight in 2018. In 2019, SpaceX’s crew-capable version of the
        Dragon spacecraft completed its first demonstration mission, and the
        company will fly NASA astronauts to the International Space Station for
        the first time in 2020. Building on these achievements, SpaceX is
        developing Starship – a fully reusable transportation system that will
        carry crew and cargo to the Moon, Mars and beyond ­– and Starlink, which
        will deliver high speed broadband internet to locations where access has
        been unreliable, expensive, or completely unavailable. By pioneering
        reusable rockets, SpaceX is pursuing the long-term goal of making humans
        a multi-planet species by creating a self-sustaining city on Mars. Elon
        is also CEO of Neuralink, which is developing ultra-high bandwidth
        brain-machine interfaces to connect the human brain to computers. He
        also launched The Boring Company, which combines fast, affordable
        tunneling technology with an all-electric public transportation system
        in order to alleviate soul-crushing urban congestion and enable
        high-speed, long-distance travel. The Boring Company built a 1.15 mile
        R&D tunnel in Hawthorne, and is currently constructing Vegas Loop, a
        public transportation system at the Las Vegas Convention Center.
        Previously, Elon co-founded and sold PayPal, the world's leading
        Internet payment system, and Zip2, one of the first internet maps and
        directions services.</pre>
